      History

      The foundation in 1932 occurred at the time of the economic discovery of the interior of
      Paraná. The Pelho family, traditional region, invested all their savings in this new initiative,
      revolutionary for the time. The founder Eduardo Simões Pelho endowed with particular
      administrative vision, led the company's business for over 50 years, many of them
      alongside his son E. S. Pelho Son, current CEO. The company name is inspired by the family name.

      The company's growth was almost instantaneous. In the first 5 years already served 18 countries.
      Hit the mark of 100 countries in just 15 years of existence. To date, it has served 740 million
      different users, in billions of different requests.

      The growth in number of employees is also amazing. Today, it is the largest employer in
      Brazil, but even after only 5 years of its existence, already had 30 000 employees. Outside
      Brazil, there are 240 000 employees, in addition to the 890,000 Brazilians in Jacarezinho
      facilities and offices throughout the country.

      Given the economic importance of the company to Brazil, Pelho family has received numerous awards,
      honors and decorations. All the presidents of Brazil have visited the facilities of the Mirror Fashion,
      as well as presidents of the European Union, Asia and the secretary general of the UN.
