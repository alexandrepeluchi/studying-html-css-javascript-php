      The foundation in 1932 occurred at the time of the economic discovery of the interior of
      Paraná. The <em>Pelho</em> family, traditional region, invested all their savings in this new
      initiative, revolutionary for the time. The founder <em>Eduardo Simões Pelho</em> endowed
      with particular administrative vision, led the company's business for over 50 years, many
      of them alongside his son <em>E. S. Pelho Filho</em>, current CEO. The company name is
      inspired by the family name.
    
      The company's growth was almost instantaneous. In the first 5 years already served 18
      countries. Hit the mark of 100 countries in just 15 years of existence. To date, it has
      served 740 million different users, in billions of different requests.

      The growth in number of employees is also amazing. Today, it is the largest employer in
      Brazil, but even after only 5 years of its existence, already had 30 000 employees. Outside
      Brazil, there are 240 000 employees, in addition to the 890,000 Brazilians in Jacarezinho
      facilities and offices throughout the country.

      Given the economic importance of the company to Brazil, <em>Pelho</em> family has received
      numerous awards, honors and decorations. All the presidents of Brazil have visited the
      facilities of the Mirror Fashion, as well as presidents of the European Union, Asia and
      the secretary general of the UN.
